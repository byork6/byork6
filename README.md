<h1>Hi, I'm Brian York!</h1>
  I am an aspiring electrical engineer in my final semester at Texas A&M University. I began my college career attending the University of Texas at Dallas, where I studied electrical engineering and played NCAA Division III baseball. I later transferred to Texas A&M, where I now study electronic systems engineering. This transition has broadened my experience beyond that of a typical new graduate, and I have gained valuable knowledge along the way. I am interested in both software and hardware development and also have found a strong passion for engineering during my college years.
